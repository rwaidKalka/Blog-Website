                The truth being said: being a manager is a little hard. A
                project manager is responsible for taking a project from head to
                feet. Altogether, it is a great feeling and one satisfying job.
                It is no secret that a good manager is one who can make all the
                difference in how happy your team is. Being a manager can be a
                demanding job with a lot of responsibility.

                A good manager is the need of every successful organization.
                They make the organization go above its weight in its
                performance. In this article, you’ll learn about what makes a
                good manager and what you should add to your repertoire. A
                manager is a person who is accountable for “managing” the
                company. It requires learning new project management skills and
                taking on different project manager responsibilities. Bad
                managers bard orders, as Mark Graban said
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                “They are directive and tell employees what to do, without any
                explanation or context.” “A bad manager makes you work, a good
                manager lets you work.” “A good manager follows the 3 ships of
                management: Leadership, Mentorship, Ambassadorship.”

                There are numerous technologies which are improving our lives in
                various ways. One of the recent inventions in the form of
                drones, aka UAVs, are already changing the world as we know it.
                Even though drones were invented for military purposes, many
                people are beginning to understand the true potential of these
                incredible devices.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                True photography enthusiasts have already tremendously changed
                the direction of aerial photography as drones are very mobile
                and can create breathtaking bird-perspective photos. However,
                there are other much serious matters that can be more easily
                taken care of by the use of these modern gadgets.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                While NASA is focused on using these big drones, a different
                team of people at the University of Florida is trying to do the
                same with super resistant mini drones, which would be used to
                enter hurricanes and acquire the much needed information
                regarding the properties of hurricanes such as humidity,
                pressure and temperature.

                Computers don't last forever. The computer's internal electronic
                parts are sensitive to a variety of conditions, and poor PC
                maintenance could lead to you needing to replace it earlier than
                you should. Some simple steps to take care of your business
                computers can provide you years of trouble-free use, and a
                greater likelihood that you'll need to replace the PC for
                reasons other than it breaking down.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                Where a computer is used may significantly reduce its usable
                life. Computers require a cool environment so that outside air
                can be drawn in to cool internal components. The computer will
                not cool correctly and cause excessive wear if hot air is drawn
                in.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                The average lifespan of a computer is typically three to five
                years, and is gauged by a variety of factors including
                environmental conditions, usage patterns, and computing needs.
                Many computers will last far longer than this, and possibly a
                decade or more if properly maintained. If you have a 10-year-old
                computer, you're likely replacing because you need to upgrade
                rather than as a result of hardware failure.
