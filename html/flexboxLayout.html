                The Himalayas, or Himalaya (/ˌhɪməˈleɪə, hɪˈmɑːləjə/),
                (Sanskrit: himá (हिम, "snow") and ā-laya (आलय, "abode,
                receptacle, dwelling")), is a mountain range in Asia separating
                the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.
                The range has many of Earth's highest peaks, including the
                highest, Mount Everest, at the border between Nepal and China.
                The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding 7,200 m
                (23,600 ft) in elevation, including ten of the fourteen
                8,000-metre peaks. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia
                (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961 m (22,838 ft) tall

                Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the
                Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest
                to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long.[2] Its
                western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the
                northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor,

                The Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7 million people,[5] and are
                spread across five countries: Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and
                Pakistan. The Hindu Kush range in Afghanistan[6] and Hkakabo
                Razi in Myanmar are normally not included, but they are both
                (with the addition of Bangladesh) part of the greater Hindu Kush

                Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा [sʌɡʌrmatʰa] , IAST: Sagarmāthā;
                Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛 Zhūmùlǎngmǎ)
                is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the
                Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal
                border runs across its summit point.[5] The current official
                elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft), recognised by China and Nepal,
                was established by a 1955 Indian survey and confirmed by a 1975
                Chinese survey.[1] In 1865, Everest was given its official
                English name by the Royal Geographical Society, as recommended
                by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, who
                chose the name of his predecessor in the post, Sir George
                Everest, despite Everest's objections.

              <p class="paraghraph">
                The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made
                by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to
                enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts
                on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first
                reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m
                (22,970 ft) on the North Col.

                Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest
                into three units called formations.[46][47] Each formation is
                separated from the other by low-angle faults, called
                detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over
                each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these
                rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col
                Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.

                The Karakoram is a mountain range spanning the borders of China,
                India, and Pakistan, with the northwest extremity of the range
                extending to Afghanistan and Tajikistan; its highest 15
                mountains are all based in Pakistan. It begins in the Wakhan
                Corridor (Afghanistan) in the west and encompasses the majority
                of Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan) and extends into Ladakh (India)
                and the disputed Aksai Chin region controlled by China.

              <p class="paraghraph">
                The Karakoram is bounded on the east by the Aksai Chin plateau,
                on the northeast by the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and on the
                north by the river valleys of the Yarkand and Karakash rivers
                beyond which lie the Kunlun Mountains. At the northwest corner
                are the Pamir Mountains. The southern boundary of the Karakoram
                is formed, west to east, by the Gilgit, Indus and Shyok rivers,
                which separate the range from the northwestern end of the
                Himalaya range proper. These rivers flow northwest before making
                an abrupt turn southwestward towards the plains of Pakistan.
