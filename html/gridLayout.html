                Hiking, walking in nature as a recreational activity. Especially
                among those with sedentary occupations, hiking is a natural
                exercise that promotes physical fitness, is economical and
                convenient, and requires no special equipment. Because hikers
                can walk as far as they want, there is no physical strain unless
                they walk among hills or mountains.
              </p>

              <p class="paraghraph">
                Many persons walk alone, mainly on weekends or holidays, but
                youth clubs and other groups arrange rambles, or hikes. The
                normal length of the walk undertaken is 7 to 12 miles (11 to 19
                km) for a half day or 12 to 20 miles (19 to 32 km) for a full
                day. Those organized rambles, combining exercise with enjoyment
                of the countryside, are in country districts surrounding large
                towns and follow a planned route. Most densely populated
                European towns have hiking trails outside them.

                Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any
                other part of the body to ascend a steep topographical object.
                It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition, and
                within trades that rely on ascension; such as emergency rescue
                and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural
                and man-made structures. Professional mountain guides or rock
                climbing guides, such as members of the IFMGA, have been known
                to be a historically significant element of developing the
                popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and remain
                so today.

                Climbing activities include: Bouldering: Ascending boulders or
                small outcrops, often with climbing shoes and a chalk bag or
                bucket. Usually, instead of using a safety rope from above,
                injury is avoided using a crash pad and a human spotter (to
                direct a falling climber on to the pad. They can also give beta,
                or advice).

                A jungle is land covered with dense forest and tangled
                vegetation, usually in tropical climates. Application of the
                term has varied greatly during the past recent centuries. Before
                the 1970s, tropical rainforests were generally referred to as
                jungles, but this terminology has fallen out of usage.
              </p>

              <p class="paraghraph">
                The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word juṅgala
                (Sanskrit: जङ्गल), meaning rough and arid. It came into the
                English language via Hindi in the 18th century. Jāṅgala has also
                been variously transcribed in English as jangal, jangla, jungal,
                and juṅgala.[citation needed] Although the Sanskrit word refers
                to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian
                interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled
                thicket" while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu
                did refer to forests.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian
                subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used
                to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the
                unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.

                Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient
                mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.
                Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with
                motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise
                involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability,
                and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails.
              </p>

              <p class="paraghraph">
                In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The
                World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce
                the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are
                prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of
                bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by
                the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in
                crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel
                time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to
                weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and
                the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling
                moderate to long distances.
