                A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in
                order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange
                files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a
                network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio
                waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.Two very common types
                of networks include: <br />
                &bull; Local Area Network (LAN) <br />&bull; Wide Area Network
                (WAN)

                A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of

                A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a
                relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic
                area such as a writing lab, school, or building. Computers
                connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or
                workstations. Servers are generally not used by humans directly,
                but rather run continuously to provide "services" to the other
                computers (and their human users) on the network. Services
                provided can include printing and faxing, software hosting, file
                storage and sharing, messaging, data storage and retrieval,
                complete access control (security) for the network's resources,
                and many others.
              </p>

              <p class="paraghraph">
                Workstations are called such because they typically do have a
                human user which interacts with the network through them.
                Workstations were traditionally considered a desktop, consisting
                of a computer, keyboard, display, and mouse, or a laptop, with
                with integrated keyboard, display, and touchpad. With the advent
                of the tablet computer, and the touch screen devices such as
                iPad and iPhone, our definition of workstation is quickly
                evolving to include those devices, because of their ability to
                interact with the network and utilize network services.
              </p>
              <p class="paraghraph">
                On a single LAN, computers and servers may be connected by
                cables or wirelessly. Wireless access to a wired network is made
                possible by wireless access points (WAPs). These WAP devices
                provide a bridge between computers and networks. A typical WAP
                might have the theoretical capacity to connect hundreds or even
                thousands of wireless users to a network, although practical
                capacity might be far less.

                Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic
                areas, such as Florida, the United States, or the world.
                Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite uplinks may be used
                to connect this type of global network. Using a WAN, schools in
                Florida can communicate with places like Tokyo in a matter of
                seconds, without paying enormous phone bills.

                Two users a half-world apart with workstations equipped with
                microphones and a webcams might teleconference in real time. A
                WAN is complicated. It uses multiplexers, bridges, and routers
                to connect local and metropolitan networks to global
                communications networks like the Internet. To users, however, a
                WAN will not appear to be much different than a LAN.

                Many technologies are available for wide area network links.
                Examples include circuit-switched telephone lines, radio wave
                transmission, and optical fiber. New developments in
                technologies have successively increased transmission rates. In
                ca. 1960, a 110 bit/s (bits per second) line was normal on the
                edge of the WAN, while core links of 56 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s were
                considered fast.[citation needed] As of 2014, households are
                connected to the Internet with dial-up, asymmetric digital
                subscriber line (ADSL), cable, WiMAX, 4G[6] or fiber. The speeds
                that people can currently use range from 28.8 kbit/s through a
                28K modem over a telephone connection to speeds as high as 100
                Gbit/s using 100 Gigabit Ethernet.
